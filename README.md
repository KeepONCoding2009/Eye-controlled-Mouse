# Eye-controlled-Mouse
The Eye-Mouse project is an advanced Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) system designed to bridge the gap between physical movement and digital navigation. By leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence and Real-time Computer Vision, this application allows users to control their computer's mouse cursor using only their eyes and facial gestures.
